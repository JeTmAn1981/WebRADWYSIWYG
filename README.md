# WebRADWYSIWYG

This is a WYSIWYG editor for my WebRAD form generator (https://github.com/JeTmAn1981/WebRAD).  I began this project as a way of learning React.  Consequently, the project is built on React 16.x with a .NET MVC backend.  Alas, the server-side code is still VB.NET.  The form generator's main interface was always just a dull list of controls, which doesn't do you much good if you want to know exactly what the generated page is going to look like, so that's why I started this project.

I've chipped away at it over the years and at this point it's not exactly ready for primetime but I have begun relying on it quite regularly for a decent view of what the generated form will look like, and also a number of field editing operations that are made much easier in the WYSIWYG editor.  I hope someday to bring it into parity with what the main WebRAD interface can do.  The main client-side application files are listed in the app directory.
